				<h3>About Amias</h3>
				<p>I have spent my younger life enjoying the creative style of life, whether that be building lego sets without instructions or throwing the Ikea instructions away before the parts had been unpackaged.  I have struggled to find the creative outlet for myself to really let loose and ejoy myself in. I initially turned towards engineering because of my love for building things, I quickly realised that did not intregue me nearly as much as building a lego spaceship; for my half alien, half werewolf crewmates.  Fortunately I had taken a Computer Science course on a whim as computers intregued me.  This started me on my journey into coding and has become a big passion of mine.  I've built this website myself and have hosted it on <a href="https://github.com/amias-burrows/amias-burrows.github.io">Github</a> so if you're curious to see the mess I've left behind; feel free to check out the links.  Alongside the programming I have also found so much enjoyment in music, this has led me to take a course in music and start a band with some of my friends <a href="https://indigobay.uk">Indigo Bay</a>.  Music is the other creative outlet I have discovered for myself and I aspire to make them more perminent, and much bigger parts of my life.  Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.</p>
